Real-Time Language Translation using Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
This project implements a Real-Time Language Translation System leveraging Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for fast and accurate translation between multiple languages. The system is designed to process user input (either text or speech) in real time, providing translations across a variety of languages with minimal latency.

Features
Real-Time Translation: Translates text or speech from one language to another with low latency.
Multi-Language Support: Supports translations between multiple languages, including but not limited to English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and more.
Neural Machine Translation (NMT): Uses advanced neural networks to improve translation accuracy and context understanding compared to traditional models.
Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech: Optional integration for translating spoken input and providing spoken output.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for entering source text and displaying translated output instantly.
Technologies Used
Neural Machine Translation (NMT): Powered by pre-trained NMT models (such as OpenNMT, Fairseq, or Transformer-based models like BERT or GPT).
Python: Core language for implementing the system.
TensorFlow / PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks for model training and inference.
